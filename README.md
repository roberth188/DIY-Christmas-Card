# DIY-Christmas-Card
A conductive paint approach for a musical holiday card. This is the first musical conductive card, to my knowledge. 

The greatest surprise is that this functions, given the very high resistance from the power supply.

The cards are set to play "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" on a piezoelectric speaker with LEDs alternating with the sounds.
